## ✨ Overview
### LunarApp is a feature-rich note-taking application developed for my Project Defense at Software University (SoftUni) in Sofia, Bulgaria. It showcases the knowledge and skills I acquired at the university, as well as new concepts I learned during development.
This app helps users organize their thoughts and information with ease. Users can create, edit, and manage notebooks, folders, notes, and tags, with support for infinitely nested folders to handle complex organizational structures. Key features include searching notes by name, filtering by tags, and using a rich text editor for detailed notes. Additionally, each notebook and folder includes an overview page where users can write clear and simple summaries of their contents, providing context and making navigation through their work easier.

## 🔧 Roles and Permissions
### 🧑‍💻 User Role

The **User** role is designed for regular users of the app who have basic functionality to interact with their notebooks, folders, notes and tags. A **User** can:

- Create, edit, and delete notebooks, folders, notes, and tags.
- Tag and filter notes by tags.
- Search notes by name.
- Use a rich text editor for detailed notes.
- Access overview pages to summarize notebooks and folders.

| ⚠️ Data Privacy: Users can only interact with their own content and have no access to other users’ data or administrative settings.

### 🛡️ Admin Role

The **Admin** role has elevated privileges for managing the app. An **Admin** can:

- Perform all the actions available to **Users**, such as creating, editing, and deleting notebooks, folders, notes, and tags.
